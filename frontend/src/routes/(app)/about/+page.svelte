<h1>About Us</h1>
<h2>Hi, we're the <span style="color: #aaa">Grey Skies</span></h2>

<h2>We make stuff</h2>
<p>
	We love to create! Over the years we've made various things,
	from bots to websites to art. Much of that can be found on this site.
	<br/>
	At the moment, our primary focus is on our Discord bots
	and the websites that surround them.
	We also make other things from time to time, though, so keep
	an eye on on our blog for when we make releases!
